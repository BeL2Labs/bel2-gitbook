# Relayers Network

BeL2的Relayer Network在解决比特币(BTC)资产托管问题上有着独特的优势和创新之处。与传统的多签、门限签名和MPC钱包等方案不同,BeL2引入了一种基于比特币交易证明机制和智能合约的资产托管模式,实现了更高程度的无需信任和无需许可。

在BeL2的Relayer Network中,签名人(Relayer)通过质押Restaking项目的资产作为抵押品,参与到不同项目的交易签名过程中。这种质押机制有效地激励了签名人诚实行事,避免了因作恶而导致质押资产被罚没的风险。同时,签名人并不直接管理BTC资产,而是根据具体交易的需要,由交易参与者选择少数签名人提供签名服务。这种分散化的签名机制降低了签名人合谋作恶的可能性。

此外,BeL2引入了一种盲签机制,签名人对交易的具体内容并不知情。他们只需对合约事件进行签名并发布,而不清楚这些签名最终会被用于哪些交易。这进一步增强了签名人的中立性和安全性。

基于BeL2的比特币交易证明机制,用户可以轻松地为作恶交易生成证明,并将其提交到智能合约。合约可以快速验证作恶行为,并立即对作恶的签名人进行惩罚,同时将罚没的资产补偿给受害者。这种自动化的作恶证明验证和惩罚机制,大大提高了资产托管的安全性和效率。

BeL2的智能合约还为应用设计博弈机制提供了便利。开发者可以根据具体业务需求,灵活设计激励和惩罚规则,充分利用智能合约的可编程性,扩展比特币的应用场景。

总的来说,BeL2的Relayer Network通过创新的资产托管模式,解决了比特币二层项目和侧链项目面临的共同难题。其优点和特点包括:

1. 高度的无需信任和无需许可,减少了对中心化托管方的依赖。
2. 通过质押机制和盲签机制,有效激励签名人诚实行事,降低作恶风险。
3. 自动化的作恶证明验证和惩罚,提高了资产托管的安全性和效率。
4. 基于智能合约的博弈机制设计,扩展了比特币的编程模型和应用场景。
5. 分散化的签名机制,降低了签名人合谋作恶的可能性。

BeL2的Relayer Network为比特币资产托管提供了一种全新的解决方案,有望成为未来比特币二层项目和侧链项目的重要基础设施。它的出现将进一步推动比特币生态系统的发展,为更多创新应用的诞生提供了可能。





BeL2's Relayer Network has unique advantages and innovations in solving the problem of Bitcoin (BTC) asset custody. Unlike traditional multi-signature, threshold signature, and MPC wallet solutions, BeL2 introduces an asset custody model based on Bitcoin transaction proof mechanisms and smart contracts, achieving a higher degree of trustlessness and permissionlessness.

In BeL2's Relayer Network, signers (Relayers) participate in the transaction signing process of different projects by pledging assets from the Restaking project as collateral. This staking mechanism effectively incentivizes signers to act honestly, avoiding the risk of losing staked assets due to malicious behavior. At the same time, signers do not directly manage BTC assets; instead, they are selected by transaction participants to provide signing services based on the specific needs of each transaction. This decentralized signing mechanism reduces the possibility of signers colluding to act maliciously.

Moreover, BeL2 introduces a blind signing mechanism where signers are unaware of the specific contents of the transactions. They only need to sign and publish contract events without knowing which transactions these signatures will ultimately be used for. This further enhances the neutrality and security of the signers.

Based on BeL2's Bitcoin transaction proof mechanism, users can easily generate proofs for malicious transactions and submit them to smart contracts. The contracts can quickly verify malicious behavior and immediately punish the malicious signers while compensating the victims with the confiscated assets. This automated malicious behavior proof verification and punishment mechanism greatly improves the security and efficiency of asset custody.

BeL2's smart contracts also provide convenience for designing game-theoretic mechanisms in applications. Developers can flexibly design incentive and punishment rules according to specific business requirements, fully utilizing the programmability of smart contracts to expand Bitcoin's application scenarios.

Overall, BeL2's Relayer Network solves the common challenges faced by Bitcoin layer-2 projects and sidechain projects through an innovative asset custody model. Its advantages and features include:

1. High degree of trustlessness and permissionlessness, reducing reliance on centralized custodians.
2. Effective incentivization of honest behavior among signers through staking and blind signing mechanisms, reducing the risk of malicious actions.
3. Automated malicious behavior proof verification and punishment, improving the security and efficiency of asset custody.
4. Game-theoretic mechanism design based on smart contracts, expanding Bitcoin's programming model and application scenarios.
5. Decentralized signing mechanism, reducing the possibility of signers colluding to act maliciously.

BeL2's Relayer Network provides a new solution for Bitcoin asset custody and is expected to become an important infrastructure for future Bitcoin layer-2 projects and sidechain projects. Its emergence will further promote the development of the Bitcoin ecosystem, providing possibilities for the birth of more innovative applications.
