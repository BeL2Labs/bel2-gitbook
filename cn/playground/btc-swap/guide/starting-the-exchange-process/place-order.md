# Place Order

1.  Click the "Place Order" button on the page to start creating an order.

    * Enter the amount of ELA for the order. The amount of ELA in your wallet should be greater than the amount entered in the Order, with some ELA left over for the Gas Fee.

    > * By default, the mode is set to `Market Price`, meaning the platform will automatically fill in the corresponding amount of BTC based on the current BTC price and the quantity of ELA.
    > * If switched to `Fixed price` mode, you can manually enter the amount of BTC in the Order.
